# Disney-Clone


A  Disney clone I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* react-redux
* Redux Toolkit 
* redux-persist
* styled-components
* Responsive web design 
* framer-motion
* react-slick
* slick-carousel
* firebase
* axios

It is a work in progress, and my first real project with React. Any tips on how to better write the  18 code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />

The future of this project: <br />

* Create an authentication flow by useing firebase . 
* create six pages (Home , Search , Login , Watchlist , Details , Soon) .
* you could add movie at watchList , it store at loacal storage .  
* you could search for movies at search page .
